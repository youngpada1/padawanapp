In my role as a Production Engineer, I successfully managed NPI cost tracking, consistently providing accurate FOB updates for stakeholders. 
Managed material cost fluctuations, particularly for integrated circuits and inductors, employing data-driven strategies and tools like, python scripts,
Power Query Editor and Power BI. As part of my day-to day, I collaborated closely with the sourcing manager to negotiate favorable contract pricing with distributors, 
resulting in significant annual savings of components used across multiple SKUs. Demonstrating proactive problem-solving by identifying and resolving production-related challenges, 
whilst maintaining clear communication with stakeholders to prevent future issues, proposing practical and effective solutions.

Daily operations included managing End-of-Life (EOL) components and alternates, strategically addressing those with extended lead times to prevent potential production delays. 
In order to streamline this process, I collaborated with the production engineering team, hardware department, operations, and external vendors to implement a new way to process and report data. 
Successfully transitioned from an Excel-based data tracker to Youtrack, significantly reducing validation and release times, resulting in a remarkable 40% boost in productivity. 
One of the main challenges I had to face this year, was to address a critical connector shortage in the Scarlett 3rd Gen series, responsible for a substantial portion of revenue (around Â£3 million), 
ensuring a timely resolution crucial for meeting financial year-end targets and supporting new product introductions dependent on this component.

One of my main objectives was to streamline workflows to ensure the smooth transition from raw data into processed data that could be imported or updated into the database. 
To reduce bottlenecks during this process, I developed a number of highly efficient Python scripts, reducing BOM processing time from 2 days to just 15 minutes. This streamlined workflows, enabled same-day releases of BOMs, software, 
firmware, artworks, and more through effective collaboration with engineering teams. As responsible for maintaining BOMs for products in mass production and New Product Introductions (NPIs), I collaborated closely with engineering teams ensuring effective 
communication with the project management team and other stakeholders on project milestones and risks.
As a result of this initiative, we enhanced productivity by efficiently managing and disseminating manufacturing data to vendors via Engineering Change Notifications (ECNs).

I became part of the Focusrite Group during a phase of organizational expansion, allowing me the opportunity to proactively implement new processes. In response, I spearheaded process enhancement initiatives both within the company and across affiliated entities.
My responsibilities extended to introducing and optimizing systems and processes for training new personnel in various departments, including Logistics, Service, Operations, Hardware, and Mechanical Design.
I also played a key role in developing software solutions for data processing, resulting in an impressive 50% increase in productivity. This achievement was realized through procedural refinement and workflow optimization, leveraging tools such as Youtrack, Confluence, and Jira. I collaborated with diverse disciplines, including IT, Power BI, and Data teams.
My proficiency extended to rectifying and enhancing the Arena PLM database through Python scripting and API utilization, showcasing my ability to navigate and improve complex systems.
Overall, I contributed to the seamless adaptation of processes and integration of manufacturing data for new companies, thereby playing a crucial role in the organizational growth of the Focusrite Group.

I took the lead in driving sustainable initiatives, collaborating closely with external contract manufacturers to explore various options and materials. One notable accomplishment was the impressive 80% reduction in plastic usage achieved during a New Product Introduction (NPI) project.
In pursuit of sustainability goals, key achievements included replacing plastic seals with environmentally friendly paper seals, substituting plastic ties with paper wrapping, and eliminating PE Foam in favor of a robust cardboard infrastructure capable of supporting product weight.
These environmentally conscious practices were extended to other SKUs, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability while carefully adhering to budget constraints. As part of this effort, we optimized product dimensions to not only reduce shipping costs but also minimize carbon emissions, aligning with our commitment to a greener future.
